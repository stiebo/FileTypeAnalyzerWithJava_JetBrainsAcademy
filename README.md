This is the *File Type Analyzer with Java* project I made myself.


<div><div class="alert alert-primary">You will practice concepts frequently tested in technical interviews at top tech companies.</div>

<p>Files come in all possible formats: we usually see it specified in their names. Even if the file type was manual changed or even removed, information about the type is always contained within the file.

Youâ€™ll try out different algorithms to solve this problem, and will see for yourself how using different algorithms will change the speed of the tool.</p>
